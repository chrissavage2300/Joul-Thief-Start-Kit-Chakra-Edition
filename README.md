# Joul-Thief-Start-Kit-Chakra-Edition

This is just a starter kit I designed to be easy to solder using SMD components. Uses a ZXSC400 LED boost converter to power 7 discrete LED's that go in order: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue Green, Blue and Violet. I designed this for a friend for her birthday in the hopes that her and her bf can do something together.

 All resistors and capacitors are 1206. The main IC is an SOT23-6. It is powered by 2 AA batteries. LED current ranges from 10,15 and 20mA depending on what resistor is selected.
